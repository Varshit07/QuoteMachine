# QuoteMachine
This is a simple web page fetches a quote for you on demand. I have built this to experiment with JS, jQuery and JSON
It uses forismatic API to generate quotes and then the quote and respective author is fetched from the JSON object and it is rendered.
The tweet button allows you to share the quote on your Twitter with a single click. 
New Quote button gets a quote for you on demand
